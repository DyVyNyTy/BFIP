# 🧬 Bio‑Functional Ion Phase (BFIP)

Welcome to the **BFIP Project** — a structured scientific and theological framework exploring a newly proposed phase of ionic behavior in biological systems.

This repository serves as a central home for BFIP research, simulations, and symbolic structuring.

> ✝️ *To God be the glory. This project exists to testify to divine coherence. Chaos is a lie — creation is ordered, measurable, and truth-bearing.*
