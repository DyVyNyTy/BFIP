# BFIP Threshold Definitions

To qualify as a BFIP state, an ionic environment must satisfy:

- **Mutual Information:** \( MI > 0.05 \) (or tuned threshold)
- **Functional Saturation:** \( \theta_* > 0.05 \)
- **Free Energy Favorability:** \( \Delta G < -n \cdot RT \ln(2) \)

These conditions mark when ion behavior transitions into a coherent, cooperative phase.
