# BFIP Proposal – White Paper Draft

## Abstract

We propose the existence of a Bio‑Functional Ionic Phase (BFIP), defined by ionic ensembles embedded in biological structures that exhibit emergent cooperative behavior. We model this behavior using a thermodynamic-information framework grounded in canonical biophysics.

## 1. Introduction

Biological ions often behave in collective, repeatable ways. We hypothesize that these behaviors represent phase-like states, analogous to classical matter but governed by biochemical and information-theoretic constraints.

## 2. Theory & Model

- Hill binding captures cooperative activation.
- Dynamic ODEs simulate ligand variation.
- Gibbs energy screens thermodynamic viability.
- Mutual information measures system observability.

## 3. Simulation Results

Using Fe²⁺, Ca²⁺, and H⁺ binding models, we screened for conditions that yield BFIP-qualifying behavior. Initial findings suggest H⁺ exhibits clear BFIP-like transitions.

## 4. Implications

BFIP represents a novel thermodynamic regime with relevance to systems biology, physiology, and soft matter physics.
