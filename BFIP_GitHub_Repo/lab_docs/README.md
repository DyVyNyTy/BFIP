## 🧠 What Is BFIP?

**BFIP** describes ionic ensembles (like Fe²⁺, Ca²⁺, H⁺) that display:
- Cooperative binding
- Embedded structural context (e.g., hemoglobin)
- Thermodynamic favorability
- Information-theoretic coherence

These behaviors represent **phase-like states** in biological systems that go beyond traditional definitions of matter.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Read `BFIP_Model_Theory.md` to understand the conceptual vision.
2. Refer to `BFIP_Equations_Summary.md` to trace simulation logic.
3. Use `BFIP_Critical_Thresholds.md` to interpret your output data.
4. Expand `WhitePaper_Proposal_Draft.md` into a publication or submission.

## 🧬 Next Steps

- Add citations (bibtex) to support claims.
- Integrate visual plots from simulation.
- Validate predictions against known ion systems.

> "The moment a biological ion ensemble behaves like a structured system — with thresholds, cooperativity, and memory — it ceases to be just a concentration. It becomes a phase."
