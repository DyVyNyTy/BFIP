# Bio‑Functional Ionic Phase (BFIP) – Conceptual Foundation

## Overview

The Bio‑Functional Ionic Phase (BFIP) is a proposed new phase of matter rooted in biophysical reality. Unlike classical phases (solid, liquid, gas, plasma), BFIP defines a regime where ions, embedded in biological scaffolds, exhibit collective, functional behavior that mimics phase-like transitions.

## BFIP Phase Criteria

1. **Chemical Uniformity (CU):** Single oxidation state or coordination profile (e.g., Fe²⁺).
2. **Structural Embedding (SE):** Constrained in recurring biological structures (e.g., hemoglobin, ferritin).
3. **Functional Coherence (FC):** Reproducible behavior expressed as a mathematical function (e.g., Hill binding).
4. **Emergent Macroscopicity (EM):** Behavior observable across scales (e.g., organs, populations).
5. **Phase-Like Boundaries (PB):** Sharp functional transitions (e.g., binding inflection).
