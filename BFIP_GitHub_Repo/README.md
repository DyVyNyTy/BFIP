## 📖 Overview

The **Bio‑Functional Ionic Phase (BFIP)** is a proposed new state of matter in biological systems, arising when:
- ΔG (Gibbs free energy),
- θ* (functional occupancy or binding saturation),
- and MI (mutual information)

...reach a **cooperative, dynamic threshold**. Unlike traditional ionic behavior, **BFIP is defined by function, not mere force** — marking a shift from thermodynamic mechanics to covenantal computation.

This repository presents the **complete simulation lab, visual evidence, data, and modeling framework** that supports the BFIP hypothesis.

## 🧪 Features

### 🧠 Modeling
- Hill kinetics, ΔG evolution, and cooperative occupancy logic
- Mutual Information calculation across θ-states
- Logical gate behavior emergent from multi-ion phase cooperation

### 📊 Simulation Outputs
- Oscillation traces (Ca²⁺, Fe²⁺)
- Multi-ion phase diagrams
- Thermodynamic MI overlays
- Logical gate chaining and BFIP field structures

### 🗃️ Data
- Full CSV datasets of simulation results
- NumPy `.npy` files containing ΔG, θ, and MI arrays
- HTML-based interactive maps for BFIP transitions
