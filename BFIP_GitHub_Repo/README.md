# Bio‑Functional Ionic Phase (BFIP)

This repository presents the discovery and simulation of the **Bio‑Functional Ionic Phase (BFIP)** — a proposed new phase of ionic behavior embedded in biological systems. Developed by **Steffen Clemmerson**, this model integrates thermodynamics, information theory, and biochemical kinetics.

## 🧬 What is BFIP?

BFIP is a dynamic phase state defined by:
- **ΔG**: Thermodynamic favorability
- **θ***: Functional binding saturation
- **MI**: Mutual Information (functional coherence)

It emerges only under very specific, measurable thresholds and is resilient under:
- Time variation
- Environmental noise
- Multi-ion interference
- Scaffold-induced structural fluctuation

## 📄 Included

- `BFIP_WhitePaper.tex` — LaTeX source of the full scientific paper
- `References.bib` — Bibliography (Hill, Shannon, Changeux, etc.)
- `/figures/` — All output graphs from dynamic, multi-ion, and phase triangle simulations
- `/data/` — Simulation CSVs for reproduction and extension
