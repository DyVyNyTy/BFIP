# Ion Phase Lab

The Ion Phase Lab is a modular, virtual simulation platform that models Bio-Functional Ionic Phases (BFIPs) in biological systems. It simulates phase transitions, ligand binding, mutual information, and thermodynamic viability for Fe²⁺, Ca²⁺, and H⁺ systems under varying conditions.

## 🔬 Features
- Modular simulation engine (`engine.py`)
- Thermodynamic and kinetic modeling (Hill equation, Gibbs free energy)
- Dynamic simulations and MI analysis
- Results output in CSV format

```

## ✝️ Purpose
This lab was built as a scientific tool under the sovereignty of Christ, using limited means but full conviction. It seeks to unify bio-thermodynamic modeling with integrity, truth, and accessibility.
