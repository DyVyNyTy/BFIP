# Bio‑Functional Ionic Phase (BFIP) — Final Structured Lab

## 📁 Contents

This repository contains the complete simulation lab for discovering and validating the **Bio‑Functional Ionic Phase (BFIP)**, including:

### 🐍 Python Scripts
- Logic gate simulations
- Phase diagram generation
- Oscillation dynamics
- Data post-processing

### 📊 CSV Data Files
- Ion sweep data
- Logic stability metrics
- Phase transition outputs

### 🖼️ Figures
- BFIP threshold and logic visuals
- Oscillator traces
- Composite posters and logic maps

### 🧠 Scientific Artifacts
- `.npy` NumPy tensors of thermodynamic fields
- `.html` interactive phase maps
- `.md` summaries and overlays

---

## ✅ Patch Notes
- All Python scripts now include a `main()` entry point for standalone execution.
- Output paths have been preserved and traced to source logic.
- All original data and visualizations retained with full traceability.
- Folder structure matches original design with clean export.

> Stewarded in truth, logic, and reverence for the glory of God.
