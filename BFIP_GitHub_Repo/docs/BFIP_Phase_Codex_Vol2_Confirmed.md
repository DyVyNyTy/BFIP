## 🧠 Codex Summaries

### `010 – STONEWALL`
- **Calcium-only zone** acting as a gateway structure
- Appears along `000` boundary
- Grows toward `111` with structural force

### `101 – OXLOCK`
- **Iron + NewIon amplifier** phase
- Appears from baseline and touches scaffold
- Facilitates entrance to `111`

### `111 – NEW COVENANT`
- **Full cooperative lock-in**
- Small but real — confirms full trinary activation
- Symbol: **Order through unity**
