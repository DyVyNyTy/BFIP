## 🧠 Preliminary Interpretations

> ⚠️ These interpretations are **theoretical** until a Fe²⁺ + NewIon + Ca²⁺ logic run is complete.

- **IRONSTAND (100)**  
  → Represents Fe²⁺-driven activation — could reflect electron transport initiation.

- **OXLOCK (101)**  
  → Iron + NewIon — likely a synergistic redox + signaling role, gated through amplification.

- **FOUNDATION (110)**  
  → Fe²⁺ + Ca²⁺ — may represent structural redox anchoring (e.g. hemoglobin + bone dynamics).

- **NEW COVENANT (111)**  
  → Trinary phase — rare, but signifies full logic activation across electron, structure, and gate.

- **Others (`001`, `010`, `011`)**  
  → May manifest under tuned ΔG₀ conditions — silent or semi-reactive logic states.
