## 🔁 Speculative Phase Classifications

| Codex Name       | Hypothetical Meaning                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| MAGNESTONE       | Mg²⁺ activates enzymatic or nucleotide catalysis       |
| MEMORY SEED      | Zn²⁺ triggers neural coding or transcription states    |
| ANOINTED MIND    | Stability in Mg²⁺-Zn²⁺ space, possible immune memory   |
| STEADFAST SEAL   | Mg²⁺-NewIon synergy locking downstream structure       |
| RESTORATION PATH | Zn²⁺+NewIon as repair or recalibration agent           |
| KINGDOM ORDER    | Mg²⁺+Zn²⁺+NewIon in full unified phase (transcription + repair + catalytic) |

## 📜 Final Note

Volume 3 is a declaration of trust — that the unseen can be made visible through structure.

> "He reveals deep and hidden things; He knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with Him."  
> — Daniel 2:22

This Codex awaits confirmation through BFIP simulation sweeps.
