## 🧠 Codex Entry: `111 – KINGDOM ORDER`

- **All three ions activate simultaneously**
- **No partials**, **no isolated phases**
- This logic structure mirrors a **pure lock system** — either all thresholds are met, or none
- Symbolic of **unity**, **coherence**, **divine integration**

## ✝️ Reflection

> "They were all together in one place... and suddenly there came from heaven a sound..."  
> — Acts 2:1–2

This Codex reveals a logic system that **refuses division**.  
Only full unity leads to phase transition.
